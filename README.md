## About the game 
Number Wizard is a guess-based game where the user has to guess the correct number. The game is built in Unity2D engine and deployed locally in the system.

It uses the famous binary search algorithm (tells the user if the number is lesser or greater than the correct one) to help guess the right number.

## Game logic
If you are here to understand/expand the implementation of the game, check out the C# file `NumberWizardConsole.cs`
